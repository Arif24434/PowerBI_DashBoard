# Project Title: Power BI sales dashboard
Description: Data visualization is a very important part of any data science project. Power BI is one of the most popular tool among data scientists to share their insights and making dashboards from any kind of data for better decision making of a company.
In this project I have prepared a simple  dashboard by using sales data with Power BI. 
Recently I was working for a client and preparing some dashboard for his company. In this sample project I have tried to demonstrate my regular skills for building any kind of dashboard by preparing this simple sales dashboard from sales data.
Data set used in this project where collected from online by keeping the relevancy with real world data which are usually used in different data science projects earlier to make this dashboard realistic.
